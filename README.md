# Software-Assignment-to develop Helpdesk prototype

This software is not working as per instructions.
It needs lot of classes and functions loops and lists, tuples.
I tried making functions and classes as per instructions provided ..some of them work individually but not together.
Import function doesnt seem to work for me yet.

I need lot of more hours of study for python to get my head around.
Thanks for my instructor , she is really hepful
